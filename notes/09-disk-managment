# What is a Partition:
When a disk is divided is name as patition. these allows yo to separete data
## Schemes
 - 1)OS, 2)APPLICATION, 3)USER, 4)SWAP
 - 1)OS, 2)USER HOME DIRECTORIES
 This help because can protect the overall system. and if we assign a number of size for determinated user, we prevent
 to that user to fill all the system with his files

 The command df -h, it's gonna display all the partitions that you have created

## Partitions Tables

### MBR:
- Master Boot Recorder
- MBR o Master Boot Record

###GPT:
Replacing the MBR partitiong scheme, worf UEFI that wants to replace BIOS, supports 128 partitions, these only works with newwer operating systems

##Mount Points:
A mount poins is a directory that is used to acces data on a partition, it is almos one mount poin in /

##fdisk:
This is a alternativo tool that is provided by the linux distribution
- Other alternativos are gdis parted

#Information that i found on internet
Now there exist 2 types of disk hdd, and ssd, in these disk you can put the type of partition that you want to use
MBR.
GPT actually is the most used in the market, it handle to create until 120 partitions
MBR only supports 4 partitions of 2tb each one

#What is a File System
In computing, a file system or filesystem is a method and data structure that the operating system uses to control how data is stored and retrieved

#What is SWAP and why we need to understand what is RAM
There are two basic types of memory in a typical computer. The first type, random access memory (RAM), is used to store data and programs while they are being actively used by the computer. Programs and data cannot be used by the computer unless they are stored in RAM. RAM is volatile memory; that is, the data stored in RAM is lost if the computer is turned off.

Hard drives are magnetic media used for long-term storage of data and programs. Magnetic media is nonvolatile; the data stored on a disk remains even when power is removed from the computer. The CPU (central processing unit) cannot directly access the programs and data on the hard drive; it must be copied into RAM first, and that is where the CPU can access its programming instructions and the data to be operated on by those instructions. During the boot process, a computer copies specific operating system programs, such as the kernel and init or systemd, and data from the hard drive into RAM, where it is accessed directly by the computerâ€™s processor, the CPU.

The second type of memory in modern Linux systems is swap space.

#Swap space
The primary function of swap space is to substitute disk space for RAM memory when real RAM fills up and more space is needed.

# File Systems
Befora a partition can be used as a partitions it need a file systems, the standar for linux is EXT
- ext2,ext3 and ext4 are the later relases
Other file systems are:
-ReiserFS
-JFS
-XFS
-ZFS
-Btrfs

To create a filesystem, the comand is mxfs -t TYPE DEVICE
example:
mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sdb3

# Partitions
To mount partitions you use
mount DEVICE MOUNT_POINT
mount /dev/sdb3 /opt

show partitions
df -h

If you do the comand mount DEVICE MOUNT_POINT, this command is not gonna work to persist between reboots
if you want tnhis, add an enty in the /etc/fstab file

To unmount you can use
umount DEVICE_OR_MOUNT_POINT
umount /opt
